The Linux kernel provided in this installer, necessary to boot then
install the system, requires at least a 64-bit CPU.

By default, booting uses "KMS" (acronym of Kernel Mode Setting). With some
video cards that fails. In that case the screen becomes black a few seconds
after booting. If that happens, just reboot to restart the installer, then
append 'n' (for "nomodeset") to the command line (see previous screen).

This installer also allows you to boot an already installed system, in case
a bootloader wasn't installed or fails. To do that, type a command like:
  boot: huge.s root=/dev/sda1 rdinit= ro
In this example, /dev/sda1 is the / Linux partition.
